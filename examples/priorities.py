# Simpleflow implements task priorities on SWF, see documentation here:
# http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/programming-priority.html
#
# Unfortunately boto doesn't support priorities as of version 2.x, so it's
# impossible for simpleflow to implement *default* priorities on SWF objects.
# But it's still possible to schedule tasks with a given priority as this is not
# dependent on arguments on a boto call, but rather passed as data in decisions.

# EXAMPLE 5: setting a default priority via the @activity.with_attributes() decorator
# Command: simpleflow standalone examples.priorities.WorkflowPriority5 --input '[1]'
#
# This has a higher precedence than the priority set at the workflow level, but
# lower than a "__priority" set in self.submit().
#
# Setting the priority to `None` at a given point results in the activity being
# scheduled without a specific priority (so it takes the default if you
# configured something on SWF, see the docs).
#
# Setting the priority to `simpleflow.activity.PRIORITY_NOT_SET` fallbacks to
# the next priority definition in the precedence list (equivalent to NOT having
# it in the first place). This is advanced usage and you probably don't need
# that.
