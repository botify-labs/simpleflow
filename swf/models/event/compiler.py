    Amazon service history events comes with a type and
    a state. swf.models.eventEvent class already implements
    these specificities.

    But history manipulation and analysis in order to take
    decisions calls for state-aware events.

    CompiledEvent has to be instantiated against an swf.models.event.Event
    from which it will validate state as initial. Then, you will be able
    to apply transitions to it from events of the same type that comes next
    in the history using the .transit() method, which will
    validate the state transition is attended and valid.

    compiled events inherits from swf.models.compiled.event.Stateful and should
    implement

    * ``initial_state`` class attribute: constructor-supplied event attended state
    * ``states`` (tuple) class attribute: every event type possible states should
    be listed
    * ``transitions`` (dictionary) class attribute: every initial state to possible
    target state should be listed.

    Implementation **example** can be found in swf.models.event submodules as Compiled*Event
    classes.
