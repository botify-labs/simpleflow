Development
===========


Requirements
------------

- CPython 3.7+
- Pypy 3.7+

The codebase currently needs to be compatible with Python 3.7.
Note about Pypy: all tests pass but some parts of the deciders might not work; Pypy
support is mostly for activity workers where you need the performance boost.


Development environment
-----------------------

A `Dockerfile` is provided to help development on non-Linux machines.

You can build a `simpleflow` image with:

    ./script/docker-build

And use it with:

    ./script/docker-run

It will then mount your current directory inside the container and pass the
most relevant variables (your `AWS_*` credentials for instance).


Running tests
-------------

You can run tests with:

    ./script/test

Any parameter passed to this script is propagated to the underlying call to `py.test`.
This wrapper script sets some environment variables which control the behavior of
simpleflow during tests:

- `SIMPLEFLOW_CLEANUP_PROCESSES`: set to `"yes"` in tests, so tests will clean up child
  processes after each test case. You can set it to an empty string (`""`) or omit it if
  outside `script/test` if you want to debug things and take care of it yourself.
- `SIMPLEFLOW_ENV`: set to `"test"` in tests, which changes some constants to ease or
  speed up tests.
- `SWF_CONNECTION_RETRIES`: set to `"1"` in tests, which avoids having too many retries
  on the SWF API calls (5 by default in production).
- `SIMPLEFLOW_VCR_RECORD_MODE`: set to `"none"` in tests, which avoids running requests
  against the real SWF endpoints in tests. If you need to update cassettes, see
  `tests/integration/README.md`


Reproducing CI failures
-----------------------

*Note: we're currently migrating from Travis to GitHub CI*

It might happen that a test fails on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/botify-labs/simpleflow)
and you want to reproduce locally. Travis has a [helpful section in their docs](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/common-build-problems/#Running-a-Container-Based-Docker-Image-Locally)
about reproducing such issues. Since 2022, simpleflow builds run on 20.04 containers on
the Travis infrastructure. So you can get close to the Travis setup with something like:

    docker run -it \
      -u focal \
      -e DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive \
      -e PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=true \
      -v $(pwd):/botify-labs/simpleflow \
      quay.io/travisci/travis-python /bin/bash

Then you may want to follow your failed build commands to reproduce the errors.

For instance on pypy builds the commands look like:

    sudo apt-get install ca-certificates libssl1.0.0
    cd botify-labs/simpleflow
    source ~/virtualenv/pypy/bin/activate
    pip install .
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    rm -rf build/
    ./script/test -vv


Release
-------

In order to release a new version, youâ€™ll need credentials on pypi.python.org for this
software, as long as write access to this repository. Ask via an issue if needed.

The release process is then automated behind a script:

    ./script/release
